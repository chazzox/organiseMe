## info
this really do be my coursework. more coming soon

written in react-native by me. coming soon to the nearest shady app manager near u

## running:
### ios
atm there is no compiled version of the app due to lack of money and hence a mac, so the only real way is
to port forward an expo dev server and access it using tunnel, which is kinda jank imo
### android

also i don't have an android device to test the app on


## extra stuff
### todo:
