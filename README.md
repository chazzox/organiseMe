### wtf is this?

this really do be my coursework.
written in react-native by me. coming soon to the nearest shady app manager near u

# running

## intro

since i don't own a macbook, or have the money to spend on getting an apple's dev licence it seems as though organiseME won't be coming to the app store anytime soon.
however, you can still run it in test mode on ios by following [the expo tutorial](#expo-client).
it is also possible to simulate an android device by using the andorid developer studio and follwing [the simulator tutorial](#andorid-simulation)

## expo client

1. Download the [expo client app](https://expo.io/tools#client) on your device of choice
2. Download this repo and extract the zip
3. download and install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v10.18.0/) the 10.x.x branch is preferable, although it should still work in the latest ltb
4. using your terminal of choice, copy and past

```
cd Downlaods\organiseMe-master\organiseMe-master && npm i
```

then type `npm start`, this should get the project running

5. once the project has started up, you should see either a popup with a qr code, or the qr code will appear inside the terminal, scan this with your phone and the ap should begin to load

## andorid simulation

    to be written as i cannot be bothered as of present
